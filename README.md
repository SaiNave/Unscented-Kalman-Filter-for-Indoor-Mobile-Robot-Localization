# Unscented-Kalman-Filter-for-Indoor-Mobile-Robot-Localization
This paper reports a method for mobile robot localization in an indoor environment. The work space consists of tables, chairs on the floor and ultrasonic beacons attached on the ceiling of the room. The robot navigates through defined way points on the floor. The robot is fed with distance to wall information from laser range finder, and ranges from beacons from an ultrasonic receiver. The robot collects the proprioceptive information from its wheel encoders. We propose the modified UKF localization algorithm fusing the measurements of ultrasonic sensor, and laser range finder. The additional part of the proposed algorithm also computes correspondence which associates a range data to a beacon. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using different sets of control parameter values which describes motion and measurement noise.
